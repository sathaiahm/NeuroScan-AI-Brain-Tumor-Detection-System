# Keep model weights for the build if needed, but usually we mount it. 
# However, the Dockerfile copies it, so we should NOT ignore it if we want it baked in.
# But for dev with volumes, we might want to ignore it to speed up context transfer if it's huge.
# The Dockerfile has "COPY model.weights.h5 .", so we need it in the context.
# We will NOT ignore model.weights.h5
